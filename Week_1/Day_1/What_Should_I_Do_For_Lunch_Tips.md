### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc) in the node REPL which you can launch with the `node` command in the terminal.

Work on your code iteratively, that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` in your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
